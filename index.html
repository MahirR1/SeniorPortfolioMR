  <div class="about"
  <p class="description">My name is Mahir Rahman and I am currently in Thomas Edison high school. My elective class in Thomas Edison is Web & App Development and we had learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. Throughout the years I had learned how to use different aspects of all four of the languages and how to use different elements together to result in the product I want. </p>

    <img src="Area Calculator.png" alt="Area" style="width:100%">
    <p>In this project we made a calculator that would solve different area problems. I learned how to use the input functions more efficiently. What I could improve on is making the comments visible to the user instead of it just being in the code.<a href="https://replit.com/@MAHIRRAHMAN4/Area-Calculator-MR?v=1" target="_blank">Link</a></p>

    <img src="Beat the Zombie.png" alt="Zombie" style="width:100%">
    <p>In this project we had to make a game in that we use prior skills that we learned in python and use them to defeat a zombie. Some of these skills are creating lists, if and elif, and creating variables.

  <div class="column">
    <img src="Guess the Secret Number.png" alt="Number" style="width:100%">
    <p>The project was about making a game that would be about guessing a secret number. So we had to use variables, if else statements, and while loops to make it run properly. We also had to make our own scenario and have the game fit it.

     <p>In this project we had to replicate a website that was given to us. Using our previous skills we were able to replicate the website. <a href="https://mahirr1.github.io/BlackGooseBistroPds56MahirRahman/" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
