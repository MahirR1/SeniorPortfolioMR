    <p>For this project we had to choose 10 amazon items and get their name, price, and the condition they are in. Once getting this information we had to put all together in a string and using the slice method we had to separate them. So the final product would be the items name first, the price, and then the condition of the product. We also had to find a new method in order make slicing easier.

    <p>In this project we were tasked with creating a tic-tac-toe game where the user plays against a computer. In order to do this we needed to create a board where the game will be played so the board is made of “+”, “-”, and “|”. After creating the board we needed to set up the computer to make moves but making it start in the middle. The player will be able to make moves with an input to what zone they want to put their move.
